## Overview

Automatarr reduces manual input tasks for Radarr & Sonarr and allows for the control of Starr apps through bots.
All bots abide by a unified pool system which regulates how much content users can download at once.

## Feature overview:

Loops:

- Remove Missing - Remove all library content not in Starr App Import Lists while respecting torrent ratio/time requirements.
- Wanted Missing - Search for all wanted missing items across all Starr Apps.
- Remove Blocked - Remove all blocked downloads in the queue.
- Remove Failed - Remove all failed downloads.
- Tidy Directories - Remove all unwanted files and directories in the provided paths.
- Permissions Change - Change ownership and permissions of completed downloads.

Bots:

- User Pools - Each user has a pool of content they've downloaded to the server. Users pools are immune to being removed by loops.
- User permission hierarchy - Can assign admins and super users.
- Custom pool size - Each user's limits can be overwritten higher or lower.
- Download - Each user can download x amount of movies from Radarr or series from Sonarr without even knowing what Starr apps are.
- Remove - Each user can remove from their own pool.
- Blocklist - Users can mark a download as unsatisfactory, blocklist it and start a new download.

## Running Automatarr with Docker Compose:

To run Automatarr using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on any Unix based system**

üí° Check with: `docker compose version`.
If your version is below v2.0.0, use `docker-compose` for commands (with a dash) instead of `docker compose`.

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` File**

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your desired directory and add the following content:

```yaml
services:
  automatarr:
    image: ghcr.io/maximilian118/automatarr:latest
    container_name: automatarr
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8090:8090" # Frontend (served at localhost:8090)
      - "8091:8091" # Backend (served at localhost:8091)
    volumes:
      - ./automatarr/database:/app/automatarr_database
      - ./automatarr/logs:/app/automatarr_logs
      - /:/host_fs # Mount the host filesystem
    environment:
      # - VITE_BACKEND_IP=192.168.1.2 # Optional - Recommended
      # - VITE_BACKEND_PORT=8091 # Optional
      # - VITE_DATABASE_IP=172.0.0.2 # Optional
      # - VITE_DATABASE_PORT=27020 # Optional
```

3. `docker compose pull`
4. `docker compose up -d`
5. `docker compose logs -f automatarr` - All backend information is here

If successful and the application is running, a directory named `automatarr` will be created alongside the `docker-compose.yml` file. The `automatarr` directory contains a `database` directory where `MongoDB` stores its local database, as well as a `logs` directory where all backend logs are stored.

`/:/host_fs` exposes your machine's entire filesystem to Automatarr. If you're not comfortable with this, that's absolutely fine ‚Äî simply omit it. However, this means Automatarr will not have access to, and therefore cannot manipulate, content outside of what is achievable through API requests.

## To do:
